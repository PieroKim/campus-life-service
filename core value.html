<u>core value</u> : appreciations of time have spent

<p>Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future.
Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience.
Time is often referred to as a fouth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.</p>
<p style = "margin-top : 10px;">Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.
Nevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems.</P>
